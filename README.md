Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
Artimes Financial is a engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world. They have aasked me to add more security to their software application. 
To identify their software security vulnearbilities, I ran a maven dependancy check, and completed a vulnerability assesment report. These would help me identify the areas of security that must be improved on. Software security overall adds
consumer trust, causing more clients to be a part of the Artemis Financial Group. 
I found it very helpful rereading through the specific requirements the companry was asking for. These requirements helped me inprove in certain areas of the application. 
I ensured the code and software application by adding log in security questions and verification. 
Some coding practices that would be helpful in the future would be the maven dependancy check and the checksum verification.
